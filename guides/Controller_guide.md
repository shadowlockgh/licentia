## Step 1.  Enable all mods in the Controller section of MO2

<img src="/images/guides_images/controller_guide/1_enable_controller_mods.png" alt="List of controller mods" style="width:90%; height:auto;">

Here's a **brief description** of these mods:
- **Auto Input Switch** allows you to freely move between keyboard and the controller. Handy in many cases especially using `OStim` controls.

- **The Ultimate Control Scheme** (or `TUCS`) maps the controller to functions. Look at the mod's page for more info.

- **Essential Favorites** prevents favorite items from being sold, crafted, disarmed, disenchanted, or dropped. Not _really_ a controller mod but handy.

- **Favorite Misc Items** allows you to favorite books/soul gems/keys and other misc items. Also not really a controller mod, but again - handy!

- **Serio's Cycle Hotkeys** allows players to map hotkeys or use the vanilla hotkeys to equip weapons, shields, shouts, and spells in the right hand, left hand, and shout/power slots. It enables **8** Hotkeys on the controller. Explained at [TUCS modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29381).

## Step 2.  Enable Controller in Skyrim

In standard Skyrim's **settings menu**, enable controller like this:

## Step 3. Change/Verify the controls

Change **Sneak** to `B`. This is necessary for `The Ultimate Dodge Mod`.

## Step 4. Setup CGO

Open `Mod Configuration` (MCM) menu, find `CGO`, it's settings should look like this:

<img src="/images/guides_images/controller_guide/4_setup_CGO.png" alt="CGO settings" style="width:70%; height:auto;">

Here set:
- **Switch Grip** - `DPad UP`
- **Dual Wield Blocking** - `DPad Down`

## Step 5. Setup The Ultimate Dodge Mod (TUDM)

Again, in `Mod Configuration` (MCM) menu find `The Ultimate Dodge Mod`.

> [!WARNING]  
> This is a little counter intuitive, so read carefully!

Make these changes:
- Set the **Sneak Key** to `Left Arrow`. _We use Left arrow for Sneak because we use QuickLoot. Navigating that screen with the DPAD up and down causes sneaking hilarity._
- Your **Dodge Key** will now be `B` because that is what you've set in `Controls` ([Step 3](#step-3-changeverify-the-controls)). That's just the way things work.
- **DO NOT SET** `Gamepad/Controller Compatibility`, leave it _unticked_. Enabling it makes things incompatible, i.e. sprinting doesn't work. Why? Ask Todd :suspect:

Anyway, your settings **should look like this**:

<img src="/images/guides_images/controller_guide/5_setup_The_Ultimate_Dodge_Mod.png" alt="TUDM settings" style="width:70%; height:auto;">

## Step 6. Setup Serio's Cycle Hotkeys and True Directional Movement

`Serio's Cycle Hotkeys` mod comes with the **setter** hotkey configured as `B` _(you can remap it via MCM if you'd like)_. When you are in game and have weapons equipped, press `B` and mod's screens will come up. For further information, **read the mod page**!

> [!NOTE]
> A note about **Target Lock** - that settings is located in `True Directional Movement` MCM, and should be already configured - **just verify it looks like the screenshot:**

## :pushpin: Final configuration 
Your control map now looks like this:
| Button | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
|**Start** | Journal |
|**Back** | Wait |
|**LT** | Left Attack |
|**RT** | Right attack |
|**LB+Back** | Quicksave |
|**RB+Start** | Tween menu (character menu) |
|**LB+RB** | Shout (in that order, you kinda have to roll your fingers across them) |
|**LB** | Looking for something to do |
|**RB** | Sprint |
|**LS** | Favorites |
|**RS** | Switch POV/Long Press Target Lock |
|**A** | Activate |
|**B** | Roll/Dodge |
|**X** | Ready weapon |
|**Y** | Jump |
|**DPad Left** | Sneak / Stop Sneaking |
|**DPad Up** | Switch grip between 1-handed and 2-handed (CGO) |
|**DPad Down** | Dual Wield Blocking |

**That's it!**
Go kill a dragon! :dragon:
