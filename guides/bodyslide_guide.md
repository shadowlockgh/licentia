You will now be prompted to name your custom mod, this can be named however you want.

> [!TIP]
> Adding '[NoDelete]' before the name will make the mod not be removed upon updating the list.
> Upon updating the mod will be deactivated and moved to the bottom of the last separator, and you can simply move it into place and enable it.

The new empty mod you made will be created under the 'Bodyslide Outputs' Separator, as long as your custom mod is below _Licentia NEXT Bodyslide Output_ your changes will override default outfits.

## Step 2. Run Bodyslide

Once you have created your Output mod head over to the Top Right of MO2 to the launch section. Open the dropdown and select BodySlide x64, then run the program.

Upon opening the program you will be prompted to select the respective game and Game Data Path.

> [!WARNING]
> By default SkyrimSE will have it's data checking the default Steam Installation Directory.
> This will cause BodySlide to not access the files properly and you will see errors with textures, missing files, etc.

In your Licentia NEXT Installation folder there will be a folder named Stock Game. Inside the folder you can 'Right Click' /Data, and choose 'Copy as Path'.
Paste your Installation Path in the Game Data path for Skyrim SE, then hit OK to continue to the main interface.

## Step 3. Select your respective Outfits and Preset

> [!NOTE]
> In the Outfit/Body dropdown list you will have two main sets of body types, 3BBB/3BA/CBBE for Female and HIMBO for Male.
> You will need to select the respective groups for which body you want to build, since you cannot build Male and Female simultaneously due to different presets.

On the top right of the interface there will be two search bars for Filter Groups and Filter Outfits, select the search icon for Filter Groups and select Choose Groups.

A list will open with various groups to choose outfits for. For Female select both 3BBB and 3BA, and the related groups such DX Crimson Blood 3BA. For Male select HIMBO.

Once you have your Outfits selected, you will need to select a Preset to build your outfits with. For Female characters the default preset the list is compiled with is '3BBB Cacophony-Varied'. For Male characters, the default preset is 'Himbo-Varied'.
You can use any preset in the list or one you have downloaded, make sure you build all respective outfits to the same preset.

## Step 4. Batch Build Outfits to the Output Mod

Once you have chosen your desired outfits to build and preset, it is time to Batch Build the outfits to your output.

On the bottom left of the Interface there is the button to Batch Build, Build Morphs, and select alternatives.
Tick the checkbox for the previewed outfit path, but do not tick Build Morphs.
