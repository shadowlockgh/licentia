These are the general steps to **re-running Nemesis** for **Licentia NEXT**:
1. (optional) Make sure `Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine.exe` is LAA patched
2. Launch `Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine` from MO2
3. Setup behavior patches and click `Update Engine`
4. Click `Launch Nemesis Engine`

> [!NOTE]
> **WHY YOU MIGHT NEED THIS?**
> 
> You added/updated NSFW, regular or combat animations that don't work with `DAR` or `OAR`; if you don't rerun Nemesis - your characters will _T-Pose_.
> 
> You want to rerun Nemesis for any other reason.

> [!TIP]
> :clock1: This process takes around 10 minutes. Let's dive into the details!

## Step :one: &mdash; _(optional)_ Make sure `Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine.exe` is LAA patched

> [!NOTE]
> Unfortunately, Nemesis is old and 32-bit.
> You will need to patch it with **Large Address Aware (LAA)** to prevent crashes.
> 
> It can be run without it, but it's **highly recommended** to patch it.

**Here's how to do it:**
1. Download [Large Address Aware](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/attachments/laa_2_0_4-zip.34392/)
2. Extract the archive anywhere you want.
3. Run `Large Address Aware.exe`:

4. When the program is opened, click `Add` -> `Files`:
    
    <img src="/images/guides_images/nemesis_guide/1_2_LAA_add_file.png" alt="Adding file to LAA" style="width:60%; height:auto;">
    
    Navigate to `Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine.exe` in your MO2 mods folder (it would be something like `%your_LN_install_path%\mods\Project New Reign - Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine - BLACK Profile\Nemesis_Engine\Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine.exe`), and click `Open`:

    <img src="/images/guides_images/nemesis_guide/1_3_LAA_select_nemesis_exe.png" alt="Selecting nemesis exe for LAA" style="width:60%; height:auto;">

5. Now in `LAA` window, click on the tickbox next to `Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine.exe` _(1)_, then open `With Selected` menu _(2)_ and click `Force Large Address Aware` _(3)_:
    
    <img src="/images/guides_images/nemesis_guide/1_4_LAA_add_flag_to_nemesis.png" alt="Setting LAA flag" style="width:60%; height:auto;">

6. Now on the right side of the window make sure that field `LAA` is set to `True`:
    
    <img src="/images/guides_images/nemesis_guide/1_5_LAA_flag_added.png" alt="Checking LAA flag" style="width:50%; height:auto;">

7. Close the program, you're done! Proceed to next step.
   
## Step :two: &mdash; Launch `Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine` from MO2

> [!TIP]
> Ensure that **all antivirus and antimalware applications are temporarily disabled**. They often prevent _Nemesis_ from completing correctly.

Open your `MO2`, in top right corner of the window, click on the dropdown menu and select `Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine`, then click `Run`:

    <img src="/images/guides_images/nemesis_guide/2_1_run_nemesis_from_mo2.png" alt="Opening Nemesis in MO2" style="width:70%; height:auto;">

## Step :three: &mdash; Setup behavior patches and click `Update Engine`

1. When `Nemesis` window opens, in it's top part tick the boxes for the following patches:
   - Archery Gameplay Overhaul SE
   - Precision
   - TUDM Attack Cancel
   - Extra Drawing Animations
   - Combat Gameplay Overhaul SE
   - Skyrim's Paraglider
   - Retimed Hit Frame
   - The Ultimate Dodge Mod

    That's where you should tick them:

    <img src="/images/guides_images/nemesis_guide/3_1_select_patches.png" alt="Selecting Nemesis patches" style="width:60%; height:auto;">

> [!TIP]
> It's the default list for Licentia NEXT, if you have any additional mods that require Nemesis and provide a patch, make sure to tick them as well.

2. Click `Update Engine`:
    
    <img src="/images/guides_images/nemesis_guide/3_2_update_engine.png" alt="Updating Nemesis Engine" style="width:50%; height:auto;">

    Wait for the process to finish _(wait for the bar on the bottom to reach 100%)_. **It will take a few minutes**, so be patient:

    <img src="/images/guides_images/nemesis_guide/3_2_update_engine_done.png" alt="Updating Nemesis Engine done" style="width:50%; height:auto;">

> [!WARNING]
> If the process errors out - you will need to keep trying until it completes.
> If you can't get it to go after multiple tries - **there's something wrong with your additional animation mod's behavior files**, and you will be forced to discard it.

## Step :four: &mdash; Click `Launch Nemesis Engine`

1. Click `Launch Nemesis Behavior Engine`. 

    <img src="/images/guides_images/nemesis_guide/4_1_launch_engine.png" alt="Launching Nemesis Engine" style="width:50%; height:auto;">

    The tool will now _slowly_ integrate your animation files into the behaviors:

    <img src="/images/guides_images/nemesis_guide/4_1_engine_running.png" alt="Nemesis Engine running" style="width:50%; height:auto;">

> [!TIP]
> This process may look as if it is stuck or not responding, give it about 5 minutes before giving up.
> If it does not complete, or it does not reach 100%, your run has errored out and you must keep trying.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note (cause I've been asked about this a few times) - **the real progress bar** is AT THE BOTTOM!
>
> **The bar on top** (under patches) is just showing the amount of animations that you have.
> It's ok for it to turn **RED**, just make sure it doesn't exceed the limit (i.e. reach _fully_ to the right)

2. When you see that the engine is fully done (bar at the bottom reaches 100% and disappears, and the log says `Behavior generation complete`) - close `Nemesis` and return to `MO2`.

    <img src="/images/guides_images/nemesis_guide/4_1_engine_done.png" alt="Nemesis Engine done" style="width:50%; height:auto;">

> [!WARNING]
> Nemesis is prone to crashing during generating behaviours, especially if you didn't do the first (optional) step.
> But don't worry! You can just relaunch it and start from [step 3](#step-three--setup-behavior-patches-and-click-update-engine), it won't break anything.

<details>
   <summary>:information_source: Here's some additional troubleshooting steps just in case</summary>

Sometimes it will never complete regardless of how many times you try and additional troubleshooting is needed.
There are still options to fix this however! 
1. Find the `Licentia NEXT - Nemesis Output` mod on the left, open it in explorer and delete **every file located inside,** then **refresh MO2** by striking the `F5` key.
2. Ensure that your `Licentia NEXT - Nemesis Output` folder is still empty and launch _Nemesis_ a final time. It will prompt for your language - make certain that it is English - and you will need to check all the proper boxes again. Then update and run the tool once more.
3. If this **STILL** does not work, you must reset all default behavior files by reinstalling the mod `Project New Reign - Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine - BLACK Profile` under the **SFW Animations** section of MO2. You can do this by simply right-clicking on it and choosing `Reinstall`. There shouldn't be any options you need to configure. It should be almost guaranteed to work this time. If it doesn't, I am stumped, and you will need to resort to Google.
4. Once you do finish running _Nemesis_ successfully, **refresh MO2** with the `F5` key.

## Step :five: &mdash; Close the tool, remove `FNIS.esp`, done!
1. As the tool is now closed, in right MO2 pane in `Plugins` section you'll see that a wild `FNIS.esp` appeared at the end!

    <img src="/images/guides_images/nemesis_guide/5_1_fnis_in_plugins.png" alt="Wild FNIS.esp" style="width:50%; height:auto;">

2. We don't need it, so:
   
   - Right-click it, select `Open Origin in Explorer`:

        <img src="/images/guides_images/nemesis_guide/5_1_fnis_open_origin.png" alt="FNIS.esp open origin" style="width:30%; height:auto;">

   - Delete the `FNIS.esp` in the opened explorer window:

        <img src="/images/guides_images/nemesis_guide/5_1_fnis_delete.png" alt="Deleting FNIS.esp" style="width:50%; height:auto;">

3. Close the folder that was opened and return to `MO2`, hit `F5` to refresh the modlist, and **that's it, you're done!** :crown:
